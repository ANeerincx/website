As a passionate researcher in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), I have recently completed my PhD at Utrecht University under the mentorship of Dr. Maartje de Graaf and prof. dr. ir Judith Masthoff. My doctoral research spanned five years and focused on co-design and real-world child-robot interactions, with a particular emphasis on enhancing mental wellbeing in healthcare contexts.

Currently, I am working as a Social Robotics Researcher at the Lectorate Smart Systems for Healthy Living and as a Lecturer at the Institute for ICT at Hogeschool Utrecht. My role combines hands-on research with teaching, allowing me to contribute both to advancing scientific knowledge and to educating the next generation of innovators in the field.

In my research, I integrate qualitative and quantitative methodologies, such as co-design, user studies, and statistical modeling, to deepen our understanding of how robots can positively impact human experiences. I am also dedicated to scientific outreach, regularly leading workshops, seminars, and public lectures to engage a broader audience and promote the value of HRI research. Through my work, I strive to bridge the gap between academia and society, advancing both scientific knowledge and public understanding of the potential of human-robot interactions.
