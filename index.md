I am an enthusiastic researcher working in the field of Human-Robot Interaction. I have a BSc in Psychology and a MSc in Artificial Intelligence (specialized in Cognitive Science). I am currently specializing in co-design and real-world child-robot interaction research within a 5-year Ph.D. research project (Utrecht University, Human-Centred Computing Group). I am supervised by Dr. Maartje de Graaf and Prof. Dr. Ir. Judith Masthoff.
