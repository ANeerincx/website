My main research goal is to make child healthcare services more efficient, effective and engaging with the help of social robots. I therefore study co-design methods for different types of stakeholders, such as healthcare professionals and children. I also study real-world social robot applications on stress-reduction and self-disclosure, including personalization and trust.

I am currently working at HU University of Applied Sciences as a Lecturer-Researcher, where I combine research with teaching. As a social robotics researcher I am currently working on the 'Droomrobot' project at the Lectoraat Smart Systems for Healthy Living. I am working as a lecturer at the Institute for ICT.
