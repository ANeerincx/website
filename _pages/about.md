My main research goal is to make child healthcare services more efficient, effective and engaging with the help of social robots. I therefore study co-design methods for different types of stakeholders, such as healthcare professionals and children. I also study real-world social robot applications on stress-reduction and self-disclosure, including personalization and trust.
