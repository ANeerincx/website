### DROOMROBOT, 2025 - 2026
In [this project](https://www.hu.nl/onderzoek/projecten/droomrobot), we investigate how a social robot can use 'guided imagery' to reduce anxiety and pain in hospitalized children. The goal is to develop a widely applicable robot that supports children during various medical procedures.

### CENTRUM VOOR JEUGD EN GEZIN (DUTCH CHILD AND FAMILY CENTER), 2020 - 2025
Het centrum voor jeugd en gezin (CJG Capelle) provides a broad range of child and family care, ranging from eye tests to family coaching. In this project we study potential real-world applications for social robots in their practices. Qualitative research methods, such as focus groups with experts and co-design workshops with children, are combined with quantitative methods, such as measuring the effect of a social robot in a waiting room, during coaching sessions, or at group vaccination days. 

### RESEARCH VISIT AT GAIPS LAB, INESC-ID / INSTITUTO SUPERIOR TÃ‰CNICO, LISBON, PORTUGAL, 2023
In this project, we designed a game played with a social robot to teach children about emotions. The end goal of the game is to help children in developing their emotional compentence skills. The game and effects of different types of robot behaviour were tested at primary schools. 

### PAL PROJECT
In this project, we developed a social robot buddy to help children with diabetes. I contributed by studying cultural differences of Italian and Dutch children in interacting with the robot. You can read the paper about my research [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7451818).
